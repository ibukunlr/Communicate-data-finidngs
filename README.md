Prosper Loan Dataset)
## by (Ibukun Racheal Olaseile)


## Dataset

> The dataset used in this report is Prosper Loan Data, Prosper is a california based company that issues loan to borrowers at a low interest rate. I will be using the various python libraries (Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib and seaborn ) for exploration and explanation analysis. The various data visualizations made in this project will help me futher understand my dataset.


## Summary of Findings

> For this project, I explored the various metrics that could determine the outcome of the loan. I considered the employment status, does the borrower has a home or not?, what their income verifiable ? What determines the BorrowerAPR ?
It was recorded that having a mortgage does not necessarily determine the outcome of your loan.
-Your Income being verifiable could be a huge determinant.
-Full time employees are most likely to be given loans.
-The BorrowerAPR could increase or decrease depending on the Term of loan,ProsperRatingand the Amount of loan.

## Key Insights for Presentation

>One of my main focus for the project was what determines the outcome of the BorrowerAPR, so I explored some variables e.g the LoanOriginalAmount, ProsperRating and Term.  There was a negative correlation between the BorrowerAPR and the LoanOriginalAmont, what this implies is that the more loan you acquire, the lower your APR but interestingly when other factors e.g the Term of loan and ProsperRating are involved, the BorrowerAPR might increae.
